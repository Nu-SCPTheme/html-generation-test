# mekhane-html-generation
Temporary repo for testing out HTML constructs for Project Mekhane (e.g. tabs, collapsibles)

**Note:** This is a temporary repo that is currently being used to test out HTML on the frontend, as well as to get a head start on some markdown elements like tabviews. Ideally, all of the files in `html` or `css` will eventually be absorbed into the [ftml repo](https://github.com/Nu-SCPTheme/ftml) or otherwise integrated in a more smooth way into Project Mekhane. The [scipnet repo](https://github.com/Nu-SCPTheme/scipnet) currently imports this repo in order to provide an easy way for me to link `bundle.js` to the temporary web server. The existence of this repo or any of the files in it should not become a dependency for any project.
